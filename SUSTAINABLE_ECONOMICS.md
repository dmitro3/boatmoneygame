### 🔄 **SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS**

**Pool Funding Sources:**
1. **Player losses** (primary revenue)
2. **New raft purchases** (50k $BOAT each)
3. **Upgrade fees** (420k $BOAT per full progression)
4. **Yacht raft spawns** (recycled 50k value)

**Pool Drain:**
1. **Player wins** (major expense)
2. **Treasury fee** (1% to operations)

**Risk Mitigation:**
- **Pool cap**: 10% max payout per win
- **Conservative multipliers**: 1.5x to 3.0x
- **Failure penalties**: Burns/downgrades return value to pool
- **Cooldown periods**: Prevent rapid pool drainage

### 📈 **GROWTH INCENTIVES**

**Progressive Benefits:**
- **Higher max stakes** encourage upgrading
- **Better odds** at higher levels (55% → 85%)
- **Yacht bonuses** (raft spawning)
- **Status value** of rare yachts

**Economic Flywheel:**
1. Cheap entry attracts new players
2. Profitable early wins encourage upgrading  
3. Higher stakes generate more treasury
4. Treasury funds development/marketing
5. More players increase pool depth
6. Cycle repeats
