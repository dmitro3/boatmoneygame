# BOAT MONEY - Economic Rebalancing Recommendations

## 🎯 GOAL: Make upgrades economically attractive while maintaining game balance

**CONVERSION RATE:** 1 $BOAT ≈ 1.56 $JOINT (5468.78 $BOAT = 8529.11 $JOINT)

### 📉 REDUCE UPGRADE COSTS (Immediate Fix)

**Current Costs → Recommended Costs:**
- L1→L2: 150,000 → **60,000** $BOAT (-60%) = 93,600 $JOINT equiv
- L2→L3: 300,000 → **100,000** $BOAT (-67%) = 156,000 $JOINT equiv
- L3→L4: 600,000 → **150,000** $BOAT (-75%) = 234,000 $JOINT equiv
- **Total**: 1,050,000 → **310,000** $BOAT (-70%) = 483,600 $JOINT equiv

### 📈 INCREASE WAGER RANGES (Critical for $JOINT)

**Recommended Changes:**
- $BOAT: 10k-80k → **10k-120k** (+50% max)
- $JOINT: 20k-120k → **30k-200k** (+67% max)

**Rationale:** $JOINT needs higher limits due to lower token value vs upgrade costs

### 🎁 REDUCE RAFT COST

**Current → Recommended:**
- Raft Cost: 100,000 → **40,000** $BOAT (-60%) = 62,400 $JOINT equiv

### 🔄 IMPROVED ECONOMICS EXAMPLE

**With Reduced Costs:**

**$BOAT Game:**
- Raft: 40k $BOAT
- L1 max win: 120k × 1.5 = 180k $BOAT  
- Net profit: 140k $BOAT (very attractive!)

**$JOINT Game:**
- Raft equivalent: 62,400 $JOINT
- L1 max win: 200k × 1.5 = 300k $JOINT
- Net profit: 237,600 $JOINT (very attractive!)

**L1→L2 Upgrade:**
- Cost: 60k $BOAT = 93,600 $JOINT equiv
- $BOAT benefit: 120k × 0.5 = 60k additional potential
- $JOINT benefit: 200k × 0.5 = 100k additional potential  
- Break-even: 1-2 successful runs (excellent!)

### 💡 TOKEN-SPECIFIC ADJUSTMENTS

**Option 1 - Different Economics Per Token:**
- $BOAT upgrades: Use reduced costs above
- $JOINT upgrades: 50% cheaper than $BOAT due to conversion rate

**Option 2 - Higher $JOINT Limits:**
- $JOINT max wager: 250k (to compensate for expensive upgrades)
- Keeps $BOAT conservative, makes $JOINT high-stakes

**Option 3 - Dynamic Pricing:**
- Upgrade costs adjust based on token price ratio
- Auto-balances as token values change

### 🔄 IMPROVED ECONOMICS EXAMPLE

**With Reduced Costs:**
- Raft: 50k $BOAT
- L1 max win: 80k × 1.5 = 120k $BOAT
- Net profit: 70k $BOAT (attractive!)

**L1→L2 Upgrade:**
- Cost: 75k $BOAT  
- Benefit: 80k × 0.5x = 40k additional potential
- Break-even: ~2 successful runs (reasonable!)

**Full Yacht Path:**
- Total investment: 450k $BOAT (raft + upgrades)
- Yacht max win: 240k $BOAT
- Break-even: ~2 successful yacht runs (achievable!)

### 💡 ALTERNATIVE APPROACHES

**Option 1 - Graduated Wager Limits:**
- L1: 10k-60k $BOAT
- L2: 15k-80k $BOAT  
- L3: 20k-100k $BOAT
- L4: 25k-120k $BOAT

**Option 2 - Higher Level Multipliers:**
- L4 multiplier: 3.0x → **3.5x** or **4.0x**

**Option 3 - Upgrade Cashback:**
- 50% of upgrade cost returned as pool reward
- Makes upgrades feel less punitive

### 🎮 RECOMMENDED IMPLEMENTATION

**Phase 1 (Quick Fix):**
1. Reduce upgrade costs by 50-60%
2. Reduce raft cost to 50k $BOAT

**Phase 2 (If needed):**
1. Increase max wager limits by 50%
2. Consider graduated limits by level

**Phase 3 (Advanced):**
1. Dynamic pricing based on token economics
2. Seasonal adjustments

### 📊 ECONOMIC TARGETS

**Healthy Targets:**
- Raft ROI: 1-2 successful runs to break even
- Upgrade ROI: 2-3 successful runs to break even  
- Full progression: 5-8 successful yacht runs to recover all costs
- Risk/Reward: Players should want to upgrade, not avoid it

**Current Problems:**
- ❌ 4+ runs needed for single upgrade break-even
- ❌ 10+ runs needed for full progression
- ❌ Upgrades feel like expensive mistakes
- ❌ Players avoid upgrading due to poor economics

**With Fixes:**
- ✅ 2 runs for upgrade break-even
- ✅ 5 runs for full progression  
- ✅ Upgrades feel rewarding
- ✅ Clear progression incentive
