## ðŸš€ **DEPLOYMENT READY**

**These parameters create a perfectly balanced, dual-token gaming ecosystem that:**

1. **Fixes current unsustainable economics** (-30% to -155% house edges)
2. **Makes upgrades economically viable** (3-4 runs vs 10+ currently)
3. **Balances both token economies** with appropriate revenue models
4. **Maintains exciting yacht-tier rewards** while protecting pools
5. **Requires zero external funding** - pure pool economics

**Execute the deployment sequence above to implement the complete rebalancing. Both contracts will be sustainable, fair, and profitable for players and pools alike!** ðŸŽ¯
